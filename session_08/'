HMAC uses asymmetric key and encryption uses a digital signature.
3 ways
1. Encrypt then HMAC (Protects decryption engine)
   * you encrypt the message first then HMAC
2. HMAC then encrypt (What ssl uses)
   * take hmac of plain text
   * then encrypt entire thing
   * hosts decrypts ciphertext first then check integrity
   * resource intensive
3. Encrypt and HMAC
   * only encrypts plain text


# Exercises
1. List some main topics you recall from mi,pki,tls.
Message integrity is important for CIA, confidentiality, integrity, availibility. PKI is the public key infrastructure and tls is improvement to SSL.
