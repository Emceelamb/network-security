## Attack trees

* Attackers are lazy
* Create a tree of necessary steps
  * assign attributes to each step
  * impossible/ possible
  * costs 
* You can also use an and/ or flow chart

## Network Reconnaissance
* DNS 
* WHOIS
* Headers
* Port scanning 
* nmap

## Types of attacks
* ddos
* destruction
* emanation eavesdropping - signal eaves dropping
* information warfare AKA "fake news"

## 6 steps of Network Recon
1. Collect Public Information
2. Network Dicovery
3. Host Discovery
4. Service  Discovery
5. Service Discovery
6. Recursion

### What info we are looking for?
* IP address
* Network Topology
* Domain Names
* user acct names
* OS/ software being used
* Security policy
* Physical security system
* Home address of employees
* Frequent hangouts of employees

## Collect public information
* Change caller id
* Asterisk server - free and open source spoofing sofware

### Google search
* `site:` searches only within given domain
  * `site:poly.edu keyword`
* `link:` shows all sites linked to the specific site 
  * `link:www.poly.edu keyword`
* `intitle:` shows pages whose title matches search criteria
* `inurl:` shows pages with in url 
* `related:` shows similar pages
* [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/ "google hacking website")
