Additional Crypto Notes
For many math problems in the Crypto lecture, the only way to learn it is to perform sample problems over and over again until you know it very well.
    1. Make sure you can perform encryption and decryption on all the ciphers mentioned in the lecture notes.  
    2. You will need to memorize the algorithms for DH, RSA, and Modular Arithmetic.  
    3. Understand the theory of cryptography. See Cryptography - A General Overview (Same link as above.) 
    4. Learn how to modular exponential math. See Fast Modular Exponentiation 
    5. Try out many examples of RSA key generation and message encryption/decryption and same for DH. See RSA calculator and DH calculator
